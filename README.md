# Navaz's MacOS Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal MacOS dotfiles.
The `scripts` directory contains a set of scripts defining Bash functions to
automate commonly performed actions and convenient shortcuts.
The `vim` directory contains custom vim mappings and configuration which are
to be sourced from the `~/.vimrc` file.

## TODO

- [ ] Install script to install dependencies for Bash functions
- [ ] OhMyZSH config script
