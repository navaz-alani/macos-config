# Navaz's MacOS Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal MacOS dotfiles.

The `scripts` directory contains a set of scripts defining Bash functions to
automate commonly performed actions and convenient shortcuts. I intend to port
these over to scripts in the `bin` directory instead.

The `vim` directory contains my configuration for NeoVim.
